# PERF: Mental Model
# every auth + BaaS setup usually has 4 env categories:
# - Public App Identifier (frontend, with public prefix)
#   - not secret; needed by browser SDK
# - Secret Credential (backend, without public prefix)
#   - server-only; high risk if leaked
# - Issuer/Audience/Project Trust Config (backend, without public prefix)
#   - used by backend/BaaS to verify token authenticity and intended recipient
# - Service Endpoint/Deployment Selector
#   - Routes requests to correct backend instance

# PERF: Public App Identifier
# read by: react client convex provider
# purpose: tells frontend where convex API lives
# feature: app can run convex queries/mutations/subscriptions
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# PERF: Public App Identifier
# read by: not referenced in current code
# purpose: convex site endpoint (for HTTP actions/webhook style usage)
# feature: not used explicitly yet
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=

# PERF: Public App Identifier
# read by: clerk frontend SDK via ClerkProvider
# purpose: identifies which clerk instance frontend should use
# feature: sign-in/sign-up UI and client session bootstrap
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# PERF: Secret Credential
# read by: server-side clerk operations (not directly referenced yet)
# purpose: privileged clerk API access
# feature: admin/user management, server auth operations
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# PERF: Issuer/Audience/Project Trust Config
# read by: convex auth config
# purpose: defines trusted JWT issuer for convex verification
# feature: convex accepts clerk authenticated requests
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=

# PERF: Service Endpoint/ Deployment Selector
# read by: convex CLI (npx convex dev)
# purpose: selects which deployment to push/query during dev
# feature: local dev against the right convex project
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=

# NOTE: Layer
# - browser: NEXT_PUBLIC_*
# - Next.js server/proxy: secret keys + server config
# - Convex backend runtime: clerk jwt issuer
# - local tooling: convex deployment

# NOTE: Feature Mapping
# - "user can click sign in UI": NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
# - "session in frontend hooks/components": NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY + proxy.ts
# - "convex sees the user identity": CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN in convex + clerk toke flow
# - "frontend can call convex at all": NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
# - "convex dev commands target right project": CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT
